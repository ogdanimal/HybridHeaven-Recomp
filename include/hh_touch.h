// On-screen ("tactile") controls for touchscreen devices.
//
// Written by epic-ship-it (https://github.com/epic-ship-it) for
// Goemon64Recomp-Android, ogdanimal/Goemon64Recomp-Android#25, and ported here
// with the Java side in android/.../recomp/touch/. See docs/touch-controls.md.
//
// The overlay itself is drawn and hit-tested in Java (TouchOverlayView), because
// nothing about it needs the renderer: it is a plain Android View composited over
// SDL's SurfaceView, so layout changes never require an NDK rebuild
// (see docs/touch-controls.md).
//
// What crosses into native code is only the RESULT: a virtual gamepad shaped
// exactly like an SDL game controller. input.cpp merges it into
// controller_button_state() / controller_axis_state(), the same two functions
// every physical pad flows through, which is what makes the overlay a genuine
// extra input source rather than a keyboard alias:
//
//   * every binding in Settings -> Controls applies to it unchanged,
//   * a rebind can never detach it (it has no bindings of its own),
//   * it merges with a physical pad instead of fighting it -- a stick held on
//     the touch overlay and one held on a real controller OR together, exactly
//     as two physical pads already do, and
//   * the analog camera, C-button masking and mods need no knowledge of it.
//
// Buttons and axes are indexed by the SDL_GameControllerButton /
// SDL_GameControllerAxis enum values. They are passed as plain ints so this
// header stays free of SDL, and are range-checked on the way in: the values
// originate in Java and a mismatched build must not index off the end.
