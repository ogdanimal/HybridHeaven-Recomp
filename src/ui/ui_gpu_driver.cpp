// The "GPU Driver" settings category.
//
// Android devices with a broken vendor Vulkan driver -- the Adreno 630 class of
// crash this feature exists for -- can run the game on a driver the user
// supplies instead. Everything here is a front end for GpuDriverStore.java,
// which owns the drivers on disk, the selection, and the recovery state; this
// file only asks it questions and passes answers back.
//
// THE RECOVERY MODEL, because it is what shapes this file. The menu below is
// drawn by the very renderer whose driver is in question, so it cannot be the
// only way out: a driver that fails to start would make its own undo
// unreachable. Two mechanisms cover that between them.
//
//  - A driver that takes the process down is caught by the crash latch, which
//    reverts it on the next launch and reports it from the launcher, outside
//    the game.
//  - A driver that starts but never puts anything on screen -- a black screen,
//    a hang -- is caught by the confirmation prompt below: it is armed the same
//    way, and only the user answering it disarms it. Not seeing the prompt is
//    therefore the revert signal, which is exactly the case a process-death
//    latch cannot see.
//
// That is why the prompt is not a courtesy and must not be made skippable or
// auto-dismissed. Once a driver has been confirmed it is not asked about again;
// keeping the renderer alive for a while is then enough (see the tick below).
