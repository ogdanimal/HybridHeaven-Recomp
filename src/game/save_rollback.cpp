// The `.manual.bak` rollback point. Ported from Goemon64Recomp's
// src/game/save_rollback.cpp; the policy is unchanged, and so is the reasoning,
// because both are properties of librecomp rather than of either game.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// librecomp rotates `current -> .bak` on every flush
// (librecomp/src/files.cpp), and every autosave is a flush. That rotation
// exists for torn-write protection, which it still provides -- but it also used
// to mean, incidentally, that `.bak` held your last *deliberate* save, purely
// because flushes were rare. Autosave destroys that incidental property: after
// two autosaves, `.bak` is an autosave-of-an-autosave. So a save-class rollback
// point has to be maintained deliberately rather than relied on as a side
// effect. See docs/autosave.md.
//
// HOW IT DECIDES
// --------------
// librecomp reports every guest mutation of the save buffer and every completed
// flush; neither hook knows what an autosave is. The policy is entirely here:
//
//   a guest pak write that is NOT the autosave's own
//     => a deliberate, player-initiated save-class operation
//     => arm a one-shot; copy the save file to `.manual.bak` on the next flush.
//
// Anchoring on the *write* rather than on the game's save routine is what makes
// this cheap and safe. Every guest pak write already arrives here through the
// Controller Pak shim (librecomp/src/pak.cpp) with the guest's own offset and
// count, so no game function has to be replaced to observe it.
//
// Correctness does NOT depend on having enumerated Hybrid Heaven's pak writers.
// An unmapped deliberate writer arms the one-shot and gets its own state
// copied, which degrades the contract gracefully instead of violating it.
//
// A HYBRID HEAVEN SPECIFIC, and it is the reason the bracket in
// patches/autosave.c wraps the whole save body rather than just the slot write:
// this game commits a save as TWO pak writes, the 0xD00 slot
// (func_800032E0_3EE0 from func_80142450_521B60) and then the 0x100 directory
// (from func_80142350_521A60). An unbracketed directory write would arm the
// one-shot and copy autosave content into `.manual.bak` -- precisely the state
// the rollback point exists to roll back from.
//
// ACCEPTED RESIDUAL RACE (seen and priced, not missed)
// ----------------------------------------------------
// librecomp fires the write hook BEFORE signalling the saving thread, so a
// flush can never race ahead of the arming it should observe. That makes the
// ordinary paths sound, but one window survives: if an autosave's writes land
// in the save buffer AFTER a deliberate write armed the one-shot but BEFORE
// that arming write's flush completes, the flush carries autosave content and
// the armed one-shot copies it.
//
// Not fixed, deliberately. Reaching it requires a deliberate save and an
// autosave inside roughly one flush latency (~10ms coalescing window) while the
// guest frame cadence is 16.7ms -- and the safety gate refuses to autosave
// outside camera mode 2, which a save menu is not. If the rollback point is
// ever observed holding autosave content, this is the first thing to
// re-examine.
//
// CONTRACT
// --------
// `.manual.bak` holds the save file as of the last deliberate save-class
// operation -- NOT "the last manual save". The looser wording is the honest
// one: a slot erase or copy from the game's file menu is deliberate and is
// captured too. That is correct behaviour, since the erase was the player's own
// act.
