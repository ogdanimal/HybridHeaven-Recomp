// block on the game thread -- a stall there is a dropped frame of input latency
// on the one input path that has no physical detent to mask it.

// A read CAN tear across the mask/axis boundary: the game thread may see a new
// button mask with the previous frame's stick, for at most one frame. That is
// deliberate and harmless -- it is a sub-16 ms skew on two independent controls,
// which is smaller than the skew a real USB pad already has between its own
// reports. Taking a lock to remove it would trade an invisible artifact for a
