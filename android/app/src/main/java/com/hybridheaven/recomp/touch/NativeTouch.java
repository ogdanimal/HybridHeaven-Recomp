/**
 * The one seam between the on-screen controls and the game.
 *
 * <p>A few calls, none of them blocking: the overlay pushes
 * the whole virtual pad every time it changes, and native code reads it from the
 * game thread. See {@code include/hh_touch.h} for what happens on the far side.
 *
 * <h2>Why every call is guarded</h2>
 * {@code libHybridHeaven.so} is loaded by {@code MainActivity}'s static initialiser, so in
 * the app these calls always resolve. The view does not assume that, though: the first
 * call latches whether the symbols are actually there, and every call after that is a
 * field test, so hosting the overlay in a process without the library degrades to a
 * pad that sends nothing rather than an UnsatisfiedLinkError. Nothing here throws.
