/**

 * <p>The whole class is plain Java — no {@code MotionEvent}, no {@code Canvas} — so
 * the input logic stays separate from Android's event and drawing types.
 * {@link TouchOverlayView} does nothing but unpack Android events into the four
 * methods below and hand the result to JNI.
 *
 * <h2>State, not edges</h2>
 * Each event recomputes the entire button mask from the set of live pointers,
 * rather than incrementing and decrementing a per-button hold count. Both approaches
 * handle two fingers on one button, but only this one is impossible to leave stuck:
 * there is no counter that can drift, so a pointer lost to a cancelled gesture or a
 * dropped UP event cannot strand a button held forever. Recomputing costs a loop
 * over at most a handful of pointers.
