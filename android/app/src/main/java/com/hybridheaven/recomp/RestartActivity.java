/**
 * Trampoline that relaunches the game in a genuinely fresh process.
 *
 * Restarting can't be done in-process: librecomp latches {@code exited},
 * {@code game_status} and the rdram allocation one-way for the lifetime of the
 * process, so a cold boot means a new process. That leaves the chicken-and-egg
 * problem of who starts the replacement — MainActivity can't, because by the
 * time its native shutdown is done it is finishing, and killing itself races
 * the pending activity start.
 *
 * So this activity runs in its own process (see android:process in the
 * manifest). MainActivity starts it while still foreground, it kills the game
 * process from the outside, then starts MainActivity again. Because it is
 * itself the visible activity at that point, the start is not subject to
 * background-activity-start restrictions.
