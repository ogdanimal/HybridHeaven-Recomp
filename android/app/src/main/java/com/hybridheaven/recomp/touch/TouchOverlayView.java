/**
 * The on-screen N64 controls: a transparent {@link View} composited over SDL's
 * surface.
 *
 * <h2>Why a View and not the game's own renderer</h2>
 * The recomp already has an RmlUi layer, so drawing the pad there was the obvious
 * alternative. A plain Android View wins on every axis that matters here. It needs
 * no knowledge of RT64 or Vulkan, so the native build is untouched by changes to it,
 * and it gets Android's own multi-touch, haptics and safe-area insets for free. SDL's surface is
 * a plain {@code SurfaceView} with no {@code setZOrderOnTop}, so a sibling view added
 * after it composites cleanly on top.
 *
 * <p>Everything is drawn as vectors — no bitmaps. That keeps the APK unchanged in
 * size, stays sharp at any density from a phone to a handheld's 1080p panel, and
 * means restyling the pad is an edit to this file rather than a round trip through
 * an image pipeline.
 *
 * <h2>Redraw policy</h2>
 * The view invalidates on state change only, never per frame. An idle overlay costs
 * nothing; a pad being played costs one damage rect per touch event, on a surface
 * the compositor is already updating for the game.
