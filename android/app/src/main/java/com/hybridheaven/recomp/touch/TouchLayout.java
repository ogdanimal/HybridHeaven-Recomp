/**
 * Where every on-screen control sits, how big it is, and whether it is shown.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately free of any {@code android.view} / {@code android.graphics} type.
 * The layout is the part of the overlay with real arithmetic in it — normalisation,
 * scaling, clamping, the C-diamond derivation — so it is kept as plain Java,
 * separate from drawing (see docs/touch-controls.md).
 *
 * <h2>Coordinates</h2>
 * Positions are stored <b>normalised</b> — {@code (0,0)} is the top-left of the
 * usable surface and {@code (1,1)} the bottom-right — so one saved layout is
 * correct on any screen size or aspect ratio. Sizes are <b>not</b> normalised the
 * same way: they are multiples of a single {@code unit}, computed by
 * {@link #sizingUnit}, which is the height of the widest 16:9 box that fits the
 * surface. Sizing against width alone would make every button grow on a 21:9 device,
 * which is the one place there is least room for one; sizing against height alone
 * oversizes them on a squat screen, where the height is nearly the width and the
 * buttons then collide. Taking the smaller of the two is what makes one layout hold
 * from 4:3 to 21:9.
 *
 * <p>The C cluster is stored as a <em>single</em> anchor plus a spread, not four
 * independent positions. The four C buttons are small and always move together on a
 * real pad; giving the editor one handle for the diamond keeps them in formation and
 * makes the cluster possible to place with a thumb.
