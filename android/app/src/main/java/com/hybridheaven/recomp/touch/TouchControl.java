/**
 * The on-screen controls and what each one presses.
 *
 * <p>Every control emits an <em>SDL game controller</em> input, not an N64 button.
 * That indirection is the whole design: the overlay is merged into
 * {@code controller_button_state()} / {@code controller_axis_state()} alongside
 * physical pads (see {@code include/hh_touch.h}), so whatever the player has
 * bound in Settings &rarr; Controls is what the on-screen button does. Rebinding B
 * moves the on-screen B with it, and a mod that reads L gets the on-screen L for
 * free. Emitting N64 buttons directly would instead have needed a second, parallel
 * binding system that could silently drift out of step with the real one.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the C-buttons emit D-pad.</b> The stock mapping gives each C direction
 * three bindings: a face/shoulder button, the right stick, and the D-pad. The
 * D-pad is the only one of the three that covers all four C directions (C-Right has
 * no face button at all) <em>and</em> survives analog-camera mode, which suppresses
 * the right stick. So D-pad is the binding that makes the on-screen C cluster
 * behave the same whether or not the analog camera is on.
