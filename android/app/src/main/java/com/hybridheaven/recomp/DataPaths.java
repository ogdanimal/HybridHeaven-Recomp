/**
 * Single source of truth for where the app keeps its data dir (ROM, extracted
 * assets, configs and saves). Both LauncherActivity and MainActivity MUST go
 * through here — they previously each computed
 * {@code new File(getExternalFilesDir(null), "data")} independently, and two
 * copies of that decision is exactly how a storage choice drifts out of sync
 * and looks like the app ate the user's saves.
 *
 * <p>Two locations are supported:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #LOCATION_INTERNAL} — primary external files dir, which on
 *       essentially every modern device is emulated <em>internal</em> storage.
 *       This is the historical location and the default.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #LOCATION_SD} — the app-specific dir on a removable volume
 *       ({@code /storage/&lt;uuid&gt;/Android/data/&lt;pkg&gt;/files}). Needs no
 *       permissions and is removed on uninstall, same as internal.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The choice is stored as a plain flag rather than as a path, and the
 * removable volume is re-resolved on every call. Card paths are keyed by volume
 * UUID and can change across remounts, so a persisted absolute path would go
 * stale; re-resolving cannot.
 *
 * <p>The choice is made once, before any data exists, and is never migrated —
 * see the storage-choice UI in LauncherActivity. An install that already has
 * data is grandfathered to internal and never prompted, so existing users are
 * untouched by this feature.
 *
 * <p><b>DECIDED: the card being pulled MID-GAME is not handled, and that is
 * deliberate — do not "fix" it.</b> Availability is checked at launch only
 * (here, LauncherActivity and RestartActivity). Pulling the card while the game
 * runs is user error, and it is cheaper than it looks: with the volume gone,
 * writes fail outright rather than corrupting, so the files stay intact on the
 * card. The only real exposure is a removal landing inside the brief window of
 * an actual 128 KB save write, and the autosave feature's {@code .manual.bak}
 * rollback point already survives that.
