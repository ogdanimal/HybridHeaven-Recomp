/**
 * On-disk store for user-supplied Vulkan drivers, plus the state that lets us
 * recover from a bad one.
 *
 * <p>Everything lives under {@code getFilesDir()/gpu_driver}. That location is
 * not negotiable: {@code dlopen} refuses libraries on shared or SD storage, so
 * the {@link DataPaths} data directory — which may well be a removable card —
 * cannot hold a driver. It is also why this class does not consult DataPaths at
 * all.
 *
 * <p>Layout:
 * <pre>
 *   gpu_driver/
 *     drivers/&lt;id&gt;/&lt;libraryName&gt;   the driver itself
 *                  /driver.json          our normalised record of it
 *     state/active_id                    selected driver, absent = system driver
 *          /confirmed_id                 driver the user confirmed renders, see below
 *          /boot_pending                 a launch is in flight, see the latch below
 *          /last_device                  GPU name the renderer actually got
 *          /last_status                  loader outcome, written by native code
 *          /disabled_notice              why we turned a driver off
 *     tmp/                               scratch for libadrenotools below API 29
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>State is plain files rather than SharedPreferences on purpose.</b> Native
 * code writes {@code last_device}, and files are a contract both sides can honour
 * without a JNI bridge in the other direction. It also means the whole feature —
 * drivers, selection and recovery state — can be reset by deleting one directory.
 *
 * <p><b>The crash latch.</b> A bad driver takes the app down before any UI exists,
 * and the launcher goes straight back into the game, so it is otherwise an
 * unbreakable crash loop with no way to reach a setting. Before launching with a
 * custom driver we write {@code boot_pending}. Finding it still there on the next
 * launch means the previous attempt did not survive, so the driver is deselected
 * and a notice is left for the launcher to show. It is armed on <em>every</em>
 * launch that uses a custom driver, not only the first: a driver that worked for
 * months and then stops — after a system update, or after a change on our side —
 * would otherwise be an unbreakable crash loop with the setting that undoes it
 * locked inside the game that will not start.
 *
 * <p><b>What clears it depends on whether the driver has been confirmed.</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Unconfirmed</b> (just switched to): only the user can clear it, by
 *     answering the in-game "keep this driver?" prompt. Not seeing the prompt is
 *     therefore the revert signal, which is what makes a driver that initialises
 *     and then shows a black screen or hangs recoverable — the one failure mode a
 *     process-death latch cannot see. On confirmation the id lands in
 *     {@code confirmed_id}.</li>
 * <li><b>Confirmed</b>: cleared automatically once the renderer has produced
 *     enough frames to prove it is alive, and — best-effort — on a clean
 *     shutdown. A human has already testified that this driver draws the game,
 *     so re-asking every launch would be nagging; what is still worth catching
 *     is the process dying or the GPU hanging, and both stop frames.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The frame count is the load-bearing path of those two. The shutdown clear
 * runs in {@code MainActivity.onDestroy}, which Android only guarantees for a
 * finishing activity, so a short session ended by a background kill can leave the
 * latch armed and cost a confirmed driver a launch it survived. That trade is
 * deliberate and the reasoning is on {@code onDestroy}; the short version is that
 * a spurious revert is loud and one selection away from undone, while a missed
 * hang is a crash loop.
 *
 * <p>A driver the latch reverts loses its confirmation, so it has to earn it
 * again if the user selects it a second time.
 *
 * <p><b>The one case this does not cover</b> is a driver that was confirmed and
 * later starts rendering nothing while still producing frames — a black screen
 * that is not also a crash or a hang. Frames arriving is the only evidence
 * available without asking, and it cannot distinguish that from working. Such a
 * driver has to be switched off by hand, and if the game is unusable that means
 * clearing the app's data. Re-asking for confirmation after an app update would
 * close most of it and is the obvious thing to add if it ever bites.
